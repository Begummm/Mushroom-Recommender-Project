# Mushroom Recommender Project#


This project aims to study about machine learning models considering real observations. It consists of data preprocessing, feature elimination, model selection and interpretation of results. Data contains certain type of mushrooms with their physical descriptions. The main goal is to find or build a model which is able to identify the edible mushrooms from the poisonous ones regarding their features.
